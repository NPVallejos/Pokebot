# Purpose

Learn the basics of creating a Discord bot while also learning how to consume a RESTful API. 

# What's Discord?

Discord is an application that is used for communicating through voice calls, video calls, and text messaging. Users can create private chats called Discord "servers." These servers can be customized with multiple text channels and voice channels. You can invite other users and user created Discord bots which offer special services.

# How it works

You run the bot in your terminal and it logs into your Discord channel. From the Discord channel you can use a bot recognizable command (Ex. '-search bulbasaur'). It will fetch information about this pokemon from <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">pokeapi.co</a> and return an embed with some basic stats about that pokemon in your discord channel.
